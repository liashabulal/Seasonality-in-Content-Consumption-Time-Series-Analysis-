# Seasonality-in-Content-Consumption-Time-Series-Analysis-
This project simulates and analyses content usage trends across multiple categories. A synthetic dataset is created using sine functions with added noise to mimic realistic patterns. The project demonstrates time series analysis, decomposition, and forecasting, highlighting periods of high engagement, seasonal trends, and residual variations.
# Objectives
-Generate a realistic synthetic dataset for multiple content categories.

-Visualise usage trends, peaks, and seasonal patterns for each category.

-Apply STL decomposition to extract trend, seasonality, and residuals.

-Automate analysis for multiple categories using Python loops.

-Forecast content usage using Seasonal ARIMA (SARIMA) models.

-Provide actionable insights for content planning, marketing, and editorial strategy.
# Impact

This project serves as a tool for content strategy teams, helping them:

-Identify peak content consumption periods

-Understand seasonal patterns in user engagement

-Make data-driven decisions for scheduling and resource allocation
